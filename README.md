## 🚀 About Me

I’m a developer who believes technology should empower everyone. Currently working on VistaLex — a smart, inclusive platform for visually challenged users and individuals with ADHD. The project integrates emotion-aware interfaces, adaptive UI, and real-time accessibility tools.

With hands-on experience in building cross-platform apps using Flutter and crafting responsive web applications with React and TypeScript, I thrive in fast-paced, mission-driven environments. I enjoy working on impactful ideas that are both technically challenging and socially relevant.
